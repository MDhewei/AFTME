# AFTME

AFTME is an alignment-free method for the automatic mapping of 3D motifs to different FGs of a specific ligand through two-dimensional clustering.

## 

[Motif_all](https://github.com/MDhewei/AFTME/tree/master/%20Motif_all): This folder contains the heatmaps, statistics results and figures for all the FG-binding motifs

- **Heatmaps**: Heatmaps for all the ligands generated with AFTME 

- **motif_analyse**: Bar plots, pie plots and venn plots to visualize different FG-binding motifs

- **statistics**: Dict files recording the motif informations for all the ligands
